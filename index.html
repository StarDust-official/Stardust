                    The Television Infrared Observation Satellite Program (TIROS) was NASA's first experimental step to determine if satellites could be useful in the study of the Earth. Since satellites were a new technology, the TIROS Program also tested various design
                    issues for spacecraft: instruments, data and operational parameters. The goal was to improve satellite applications for Earth-bound decisions. TIROS proved extremely successful, providing the first accurate weather forecasts based
                    on data gathered from space. The program's success with many instrument types and orbital configurations led to the development of more sophisticated meteorological observation satellites.

                    Nimbus 1, the first in a series of second-generation meteorological research-and-development satellites, was designed to serve as a stabilized, earth-oriented platform for the testing of advanced meteorological sensor systems and for collecting meteorological
                    data. It consisted of three major elements: a sensory ring, solar paddles, and the control system housing. The solar paddles and the control system housing were connected to the sensory ring by a truss structure, giving the satellite
                    the appearance of an ocean buoy.

                <p class="content">
                    The Environmental Science Services Administration (ESSA) satellite program was initiated as an extension of, and a compliment to, the TIROS program. Like TIROS, the ESSA programâ€™s primary objective was to provide cloud-cover photography to the American
                    National Meteorological Center. ESSA imagery was of a much wider scope, and better resolution, than that of the TIROS 9 program. ESSA satellite design and missions were the result of a combined effort on the part of NASA, the ESSA,
                    the U.S. Weather Bureau, and the National Meteorological Center. Its success prompted further exploration of using space-borne weather prediction and monitoring devices, like ATS and the NIMBUS series.

                    The Applications Technology Satellite (ATS) series was conceived of as a follow-on to the successful experimental communications satellites of the early 1960s with the addition of other technology demonstrations, such as weather observation and investigation
                    of the space environment. The Department of Defense (DoD) influenced NASA to include technology for gravity-gradient stabilization (on ATS-2, ATS-4, and ATS-5) and for medium-altitude orbits (ATS-2). All five of the first generation
                    ATS spacecraft carried a C-band transponder with 25 MHz bandwidth capable of relaying 1200 one-way voice circuits or one color television signal.
